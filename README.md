};
```

## Multiplayer Features

### How It Works

**Auction Flow:**
1. Host builds auction queue from 574 IPL players (organized by auction sets)
2. Host starts auction and emits queue sync to all guests
3. Players are announced one by one with base prices
4. Teams bid in real-time - bids broadcast to all players
5. Timer counts down (synced from host to all guests)
6. At 0 seconds: Player sold to highest bidder or marked unsold
7. Host broadcasts next player announcement to all guests
8. Repeat until all players auctioned

**Real-time Synchronization:**
- ✅ **Bid Broadcasting**: When a team bids, host emits `auctionBid` → Server relays to all guests
- ✅ **Timer Sync**: Host broadcasts `auctionTimerUpdate` every second → All guests sync their countdown
- ✅ **Sold Player Event**: Host emits `auctionPlayerSold` → Server relays to all guests
- ✅ **Next Player Announcement**: Host emits `auctionNextPlayer` → Server relays to all guests
- ✅ **Queue Sync**: Host syncs entire queue at start via `auctionQueueSync`

### Socket.IO Events

**Auction-specific Events:**
```javascript
// Client → Server
'auctionBid'              // Place a bid
'auctionPlayerSold'       // Player sold notification
'auctionPlayerUnsold'     // Player unsold notification
'auctionTimerUpdate'      // Timer broadcast (host only)
'auctionNextPlayer'       // Next player announcement (host only)
'auctionQueueSync'        // Queue synchronization (host only)

// Server → Client
'auctionBidUpdate'        // Broadcast bid to all
'auctionPlayerSold'       // Broadcast sold
'auctionPlayerUnsold'     // Broadcast unsold
'auctionTimerUpdate'      // Broadcast timer
'auctionNextPlayer'       // Broadcast next player
'auctionQueueSync'        // Broadcast queue
```

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Render.com)

1. **Push code to GitHub**
2. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)** → Create New → Web Service
3. **Connect your GitHub repo**
4. **Configure:**
   - **Build Command:** `cd server && npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `node server/server.js`
   - **Environment Variables:**
     ```
     PORT=4000
     NODE_ENV=production
     FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
     ```
5. **Deploy** - Note the URL (e.g., `https://cricsim-pro.onrender.com`)

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. **Update `vercel.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "VITE_SOCKET_SERVER": "https://cricsim-pro.onrender.com"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub** - Vercel auto-deploys on push
3. **Test** - Your live multiplayer auction is ready!

## Troubleshooting

### Bidding Issues

**Button is disabled:**
- Check if your team has sufficient purse balance
- Ensure squad is not full (max 25 players)
- If team is overseas-heavy, check overseas limit (max 8)
- Wait for another team to bid (no consecutive bidding)

**Bids not syncing:**
- Verify Socket.IO connection: F12 → Network → look for WebSocket
- Ensure both clients are in same room (check room code)
- Restart browser tabs
- Check server logs for errors

### Connection Issues

**Can't connect to backend:**
- Verify backend is running: `http://localhost:4000`
- Check `VITE_SOCKET_SERVER` in `vercel.json`
- Ensure CORS is configured properly in `server/server.js`

**Multiplayer not working:**
- Both players must be in same room
- Host must click "Start Auction"
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Timer/Sync Issues

**Timer out of sync:**
- Host's timer is the source of truth - guests receive broadcasts
- If still out of sync, refresh page
- Check network latency (high latency may cause delays)

**Players not seeing next player:**
- Host must successfully announce next player (after 3.5s delay)
- If stuck, refresh page
- Check server logs for `auctionNextPlayer` events

---

## Key Improvements Made

### Multiplayer Auction Fixes (v3.2)
- ✅ **Player Progression**: Host and guests move to next player simultaneously
- ✅ **Timer Synchronization**: Host broadcasts timer every second to all guests
- ✅ **Bid Button State**: Guests can bid immediately on next player
- ✅ **Sold Overlay**: All players see celebratory overlay when player is sold
- ✅ **Queue Management**: Only host manages queue, guests wait for announcements
- ✅ **Bidding State**: `currentBidder` clears for all clients when player is sold

Host broadcasts every second:
  - auctionTimerUpdate (timer: 10, playerName: "X")
  - Server relays to guests
  - Guests update their timer

Host broadcasts when player sold:
  - auctionPlayerSold (player, teamId, price)
  - Server relays to guests
  - Guests show overlay, update teams

Host announces next player:
  - auctionNextPlayer (player: {...})
  - Server relays to guests
  - All clients show new player simultaneously
